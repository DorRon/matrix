//To declare variables in Java you need to declare the variable type, followed by the variable name.
//Declare variables as follows

int number;                 //Declares int type variable called number
boolean g;                  //Declares boolean type variable called g

//on a different line you would then assign the declared variable a value as such
number = 78;
g = true;

//you can however declare a variable and assign it on the same line as follows
int number = 78;            //declares int type variable number and assigns the value 78 to it
boolean g = true;           //declares boolean type variable g and assigns the value true to it
