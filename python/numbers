#There's a lot you can do with numbers in Python

import math         # imports math module, we will use this later

5                   # prints 5
3 + 5               # adds 3 and 5 to get 8
5 - 1               # subtracts 1 from 5 to get 4 
6 * 7               # multiplies 6 and 7 to get 42
9 / 3               # divides 9 by 3 to get 3
9 / 2               # divides 9 by 2 to get 4. You don't get 4.5 because dividing 2 int types can't translate into a float therefore do
9.0 / 2.0           # TA-DA! now you should get 4.5 as your answer
2**5                # 2 to the power of 5 to get 32
11 % 2              # finds the remainder of 11 divided by 2 which is 1
2 == 2              # prints true since equals 2
2 < 1               # prints false since 2 isn't less than 1
2 <=2               # prints true since 2 is less than or EQUAL to itself
2 > 1               # prints true since 2 is greater than 1
2 >= 2              # prints true since 2 is greater than or EQUAL to itself 
3 != 8              # prints true since 3 is not equal to 8
abs(-3)             # prints the absolute value of negative 3, which is 3

#Now time to use the math module, you must import math in order to execute these commands

math.floor(18.9)    #this rounds down any number, even if it should be rounded up so 18.9 --> 18.0
math.ceil(12.4)     #this rounds up any number, even if it should be rounded down so 12.4 --> 13.0
math.sqrt(81)       #this takes the square root of the number in the parameters so 81 --> 9.0
math.pi             #prints pi which is 3.1415926535897931
math.factorial(9)   #Finds the factorial of which is 362880 
math.e              #prints the mathematical constant e which is 2.7182818284590451
math.pow(3,4)       #prints 3 to the 4th power which is 81.0 note: An alternitive would be doing 3**4
