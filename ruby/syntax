#Ruby's syntax is somewhat different from other languages.

#In terms of control flow, ruby utilize whitespace nor curly braces
#However, ruby requires you to type the keyword end at the end of some blocks.

a = true
if a == true
	puts "a is true!"
else									#end is not necessary with else and elsif.
	puts "a is false"
end										#however end is necessary for each if statement.

b = false
if b == true
	puts "b is true!"
end

#Loops are somewhat different in ruby as well.

array = [1,2,3,4,5]
array.each do |x|			#looping through an array
	puts x							#prints out each number on a seperate line.
end

(1..5).each do |x|		#replacement for for loop
	puts x							#does same thing as above example
end

(1..5).each { |x| puts x }		#does the same thing as above examples
															#but only on one line :)
