# To declare new variables in ruby do as follows
x = true               # x has the boolean value of true
y = "Ruby String!"      # y equals the string Ruby String!

#You may declare multiple variables on the same line as follows
x, y, z = 6, 7, 8 

#In the above example x is equivalent to 6, y is equivalent to 7, and z is equivalent to 8

=begin
Note: if the variable name begins with a capital letter
Ruby will treat it as a Constant. What this means is, that
the value of that variable shouldn't change. However, if you do
reassign that variable with a different value, ruby will allow 
you to do so, but will give you a warning. Do not be alarmed by it.
So for example as follows.
=end

ExConstant = 9         # ExConstant is equal to 9
ExConstant = 11        # ExConstant is equal to 11 now

=begin
The ruby interpreter will give you this message:
warning: already initialized constant ExConstant
warning: previous definition of ExConstant was here
=> 11

You may ignore this message, since ExConstant's value was infact changed to 11
=end
