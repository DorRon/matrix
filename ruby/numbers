#There are two basic number types in ruby
#The first is Integer
#The second is Float

3				#returns 3
2.7			#returns 2.7

#Basic arithmetic works, too

3+2			#returns 5
2+2.5		#returns 4.5

3-2			#returns 1
3-2.5		#returns 0.5

3*2 		#returns 6
4*1.5		#returns 6

4/2 		#returns 2
5/2			#also returns 2, but only because it can only return an int value
5.0/2 	#returns 2.5, as you would expect
5/2.0		#also returns 2.5, as you would expect
5.0/2.0		#also returns 2.5


#modulus also works as it would in other languages.
5%2 		#this would return 1, as the remainder of 5%2 is 1
4%2 		#returns 0, as 4 is divisible by 2

#exponents
5**2 		#returns 25
