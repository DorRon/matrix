#Booleans in ruby can be assigned to variables as follows
truth = true
lies = false

#Boolean operators are as follows
2 == 2                         #This is true because 2 equals itself
2 != 2                         #This is false because 2 does equal itself
2 > 1                          #true because 2 is greater than 1
2 < 1                          #false because 2 isn't less than 1
2 >= 2                         #true because 2 is greater than or EQUAL to itself
2 <= 2                         #true becuase 2 is less than or EQUAL to itself

#Also if you add an exclamation point infront of a statement it negates it so
!(2 == 2)                      #false because 2 equals 2 is true and negate that making false
!(2 > 3)                       #true because 2 is greater than 3 is false and negate that making it true

#There are also AND and OR conditons. 2 ampersands represnt "and", 2 vertical bars represent "or"
(2 == 2 && 2 < 4)              #2 true statements evaluate to true
(2 != 3 && 2 < 1)              #One true AND one false statement evaluate to false when using double ampersand
(5 > 7  && 4 < 3)              #2 false statements evaluate to false

(6 == 6 || 6 < 8)              #2 true statements evaluate to true
(8 < 10 || 2 < 1)              #1 true OR one false statement evaluate to true when using two vertical bars
(1 > 7  || 5 < 4)              #2 false statements evaluate to false
