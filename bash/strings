# because (just about) everything is a string in bash,
# there are large number of tools for manipulating strings

STR="this is a string"

# there are a few different ways to get the length of a string:
echo ${#STR} # 16
echo `expr length $STR` # 16, GNU utils only
expr "$STR" : '.*' # 16

# you can also outsource to utilities with a pipe:
echo $STR | awk '{print length}' # 16

# you can also get indices and substrings:
echo `expr index "$STR" hi` # prints 2, GNU utils only
echo ${STR:8} # "a string"
echo ${STR:0:4} # "this"
