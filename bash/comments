# single line comments begin with a single hash (#)

# there are no real multi-line comments in bash,
# but there are a few workarounds:

<<COMMENT
	This is a here-doc. 
	It can be used as a comment when not used with other commands.
COMMENT

: '
	This has no side effects, as the : command does nothing
	besides expanding its arguments.
