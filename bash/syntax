# statements in bash end with a newline and are made up of utility calls
cd /a/directory/on/your/computer # change directory
ls # list files

# statements can, however, be chained together:
cd ; ls # change directory, then list files
cd && ls # attempt to list files only if change directory succeeds ('and' operation)
cd || ls # attempt to list files regardless of cd's success ('or' operation)

# you can also create and call functions in bash:
function my_func()
{
	echo "Hello World"
}

my_func
