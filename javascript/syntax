// Statements in javascript end with a semicolon
doSomething();

// But they don't always have to
doSomething() // This works just fine

// But be careful. There are some weird things that can happen when there's no
// semicolon because javascript automatically tries to insert them whenever
// there's a newline. So it's better to use semicolons in practice and be explicit
// about it.
