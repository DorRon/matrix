var x; // You declare new variables with the var statement
x // undefined

x = 5; // x now has the value of 5
var y = "bento" // y is initialized and now has the string "bento" assigned to it

var log = console.log; //you can assign shorter var to strings that already exist like console.log() which basically logs info to the console for debugging.
//an example of using log would be
  log("This is now console.log!");
