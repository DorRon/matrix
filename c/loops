/* there are three major loops in C: for, while, and do-while */

/* a for loop iterates n times until its condition fails: */
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) /* C99 style. In C89, 'i' must be declared before */
{
	printf("%d\n", i); /* i is printed 10 times (0, 1, 2, ..., 9)
}

/* a while loop repeats until its condition fails */
while (i >= 0)
{
	printf("%d\n", i);
}

/* a do-while loop repeats at least once, until its condition fails */
do
{
	int c = getchar(); /* int is used to accomodate the EOF character */
	putchar(c);
} while (c != '\n')

/* you can also have infinite loops: */
for (;;) { } /* blank statements, making the loop evaluate infinitely */
while (1) { } /* true can also be used in C99 */
