/* C is a procedural language, and does not have objects */
/* However, it does have data structures that represent data one-to-one in memory */

/* FILE pointers can be used to access files: */
FILE *my_file = fopen("/the/file", "r"); /* open a file for reading */

/* you can also define structures */
struct apple

/* struct elements can then be accessed with the dot operator: */
